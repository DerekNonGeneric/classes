Programming Excersises
======================

No Tablaeu allowed for programming Excersises. We want you to gain experience with python while doing the programming.
These are also warmup excersises for the project. If you have difficulties with them we recommend yo do a paper instead of a project.


Introduction
------------

1. Setup
   
   Set up Raspberry   
   Set up virtual box (ubuntu 16.04)

2. Elementary Linux

   Find most useful Linux commands for your work that you have done and document some of their use

3. What is apt-get and how do you use it?

   Name one program you installed with apt-get and list the command you used for it
   
4. How do you install Python 3 on your computer?

   Demonstarte that you indeed use Python 3 on your computer and not anaconda as that may mess up your environment.

5. Why should you not use anaconda?

Jupyter
-------   
6. What is jupyter and how can you use it?

Matplotlib
----------

7. Write a jupyter notebook using a histogram using matplotlib with real data of your choice

   Document the source of the data and describe what the data represents

   tip: hist
   
8. Write a jupyter notebook using a scatter demo program with real data of your choice

   tip: scatter
   
9. Write a jupyter notebook using a box plot demo program with real data of your choice

   tip: boxplot

10. Write a jupyter notebook using a 3d plot with real data of your choice

Scikit-Learn
------------

11. Install scikit-learn (via pip not via conda).

    Provide evidence you installed it

12. K-means

    Provide a meaningfull dataset on which you apply k-means with scikit-learn

    See for inspiration

Numpy
-----

13. Provide an example to define an array in numpy and determine its sum

12. Read in a csv file with Numpy of your choice in numpy and plot a histogram

Pandas
------

13. Provide an example to define an array in pandas and determine its sum

12. Read in a csv file with Pandas of your choice in numpy and plot a histogram

What is a series

What is a dataframe

Pygal
-----

Take the history data and create a pygal image

What is the difference between matplot lib images and pygal

Where is pygal better
Where is matplotlib better
