Hyungro Lee is a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Indiana University
working with Dr. Geoffrey C. Fox. Prior to beginning the PhD program,
Hyungro worked as a software engineer in the Cyworld Group (social
networking platform in South Korea) at SK Communications, developing
communications platforms including emails, texts and messaging at large
scale to support over 40 million users. From this work he developed an
interest in how distributed systems achieve scalability and high
availability along with managing resources efficiently. He is currently
working on the FutureSystems project to support Big Data Analysis
Software Stacks in Virtual Clusters. He was also working on the
FutureGrid project, an NSF funded significant new experimental computing
grid and cloud test-bed to the research community, together with user
supports. His research interests are parallel and distributed systems,
and cloud computing

Jerome Mitchell is a Ph.D candidate in computer science at Indiana
University and is interested in coupling the fields of computer and
polar science. He has participated in the United State Antarctic
Program, (USAP), where he collaborated with a multidisciplinary team
of engineers and scientists to design a mobile robot for harsh polar
environments to autonomously collect ice sheet data, decrease the
human footprint of polar expeditions, and enhance measurement
precision. His current work include: using machine learning techniques
to help polar scientists identify bedrock and internal layers in radar
imagery. He has also been involved in facilitating workshops to
educate faculty and students on the importance of parallel and
distributed computing at minority-serving institutions.
