Introduction
---------------

.. note:: You may find that some videos may have a different lesson,
	  section or unit number. Please ignore this. In case the
	  content does not correspond to the title, please let us know.


This section has a technical overview of course followed by a broad
motivation for course.

The course overview covers it's content and structure. It presents an
introduction to general field of Big Data and Analytics. We are
especially analysing the many different application areas in which Big
Data can be applied. As Big Datais typically not just used in
isolation but is part of a larger Informatics issue for a particular
field we also use the term X-Informatics, where X defines a usecase or
area of specialization in which Big Data is applied to. As such we
organize the class around the the *Rallying Cry* of course: Use Clouds
running Data Analytics Collaboratively processing Big Data to solve
problems in X-Informatics.

The courses is set up as a number of lessons that are typically
between 20 minutes to an hour. The lessons are either provided as
written documents or as video lectures. They are enhanced by an in
person meeting that takes place either in a lecture room for
residential students or as online meeting for online students. 

The course covers a mix of applications (the X in X-Informatics) and
technologies needed to support the field electronically i.e. to
process the application data. The overview ends with a discussion of
course content at highest level. The course starts with a motivation
summarizing clouds and data science, then units describing
applications in areas such as Physics, e-Commerce, Web Search and Text
mining, Health, Sensors and Remote Sensing). These are interspersed
with discussions of infrastructure (clouds) and data analytics
(algorithms like clustering and collaborative filtering used in
applications). The course uses Python as primary programming language.
We will be introducing practical use of cloud resources so that you
have the oportunity to explore example analytics applications on
smaller data sets that you define.

The course motivation starts with striking examples of the data deluge
with examples from research, business and the consumer. The growing
number of jobs in data science is highlighted. He describes industry
trend in both clouds and big data. Then the cloud computing model
developed at amazing speed by industry is introduced. The 4 paradigms
of scientific research are described with growing importance of data
oriented version.He covers 3 major X-informatics areas: Physics,
e-Commerce and Web Search followed by a broad discussion of cloud
applications. Parallel computing in general and particular features of
MapReduce are described. 



Course Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We provide a short introduction to the course covering it's
content and structure. It presents the X-Informatics fields (defined
values of X) and the Rallying cry of course: Use Clouds running Data
Analytics Collaboratively processing Big Data to solve problems in
X-Informatics (or e-X).

Computing Model
""""""""""""""""

*Industry adopted clouds which are attractive for data analytics*

Clouds and Big Data are transformational on a 2-5 year time scale.
Already Amazon AWS is a lucrative business with almost a $4B revenue.
We describe the nature of cloud centers with economies of scale
and gives examples of importance of virtualization in server
consolidation. Then key characteristics of clouds are reviewed with
expected high growth in Infrastructure, Platform and Software as a
Service.

Physics-Informatics
"""""""""""""""""""
*Looking for Higgs Particle with Large Hadron Collider LHC*

We look at important particle physics example where the Large
hadron Collider has observed the Higgs Boson. He shows this discovery
as a bump in a histogram; something that so amazed him 50 years ago
that he got a PhD in this field. He left field partly due to the
incredible size of author lists on papers.

Recommender Systems
"""""""""""""""""""

Many important applications involve matching users, web pages, jobs,
movies, books, events etc. These are all optimization problems with
recommender systems one important way of performing this optimization.
We go through the example of Netflix ~~ everything is a
recommendation and muses about the power of viewing all sorts of
things as items in a bag or more abstractly some space with funny
properties.

This course also looks at Web Search and here we give an
overview of the data analytics for web search, Pagerank as a method of
ranking web pages returned and uses material from Yahoo on the subtle
algorithms for dynamic personalized choice of material for web pages.

Data Science Education
""""""""""""""""""""""

We discuss one reason you are taking this course ~~ Data
Science as an educational initiative and aspects of its Indiana
University implementation. Then general; features of online education
are discussed with clear growth spearheaded by MOOC's where we
use this course and others as an example. He stresses the choice
between one class to 100,000 students or 2,000 classes to 50 students
and an online library of MOOC lessons. In olden days he suggested
''hermit's cage virtual university'' ~~ gurus in isolated caves
putting together exciting curricula outside the traditional university
model. Grading and mentoring models and important online tools are
discussed. Clouds have MOOC's describing them and MOOC's are stored in
clouds; a pleasing symmetry.

The conclusions highlight clouds, data-intensive methodology,
employment, data science, MOOC's and never forget the Big Data
ecosystem in one sentence "Use Clouds running Data Analytics
Collaboratively processing Big Data to solve problems in X-Informatics
