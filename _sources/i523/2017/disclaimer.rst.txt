It is normal that questions posed by the students in the
online and residential classes lead to improvements and clarifications
of the content published on the class Web pages. Hence you need to
revisit the page updates. Just as in other years we provide a
changelog. Changes will not lead to any requirements change to the class
but only improving the content. However, we have learned from previous
classes that additional homework may need to be added in case the
class participants need to grasp a concept better to simplify their
work.

.. note:: It is important to understand that we release content
          
   * on a weekly basis
   * content may be in draft form so we can improve it with your help

Please note that your are not required to look at lectures or assignments
that are not yet released for this class. However, you could get credit
if you improve the content with us.

We expect that you help at least to improve spelling and grammar errors.
