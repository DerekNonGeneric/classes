===============================================

.. warning:: This material will be modified and updated on a weekly
             bases througought the semester. Some unit and section
             numbers in the presentations may not correspond to our
             outline here as we have restructured the material.

.. note:: This class has a significant amount of programming
          assignments. However an option of taking the class without
          programming project is available. Those electing not to do
          the programming need to write an additional paper.  The
          maximum grade of those conducting the non programming option
          is an A-. It is still expected that you conduct the
          programming assignments even if you do not chose the
          programming project.

.. note:: This class will not have any bonus projects as we want that
          you apply your focus on the class homework instead and make
          them outstanding.
