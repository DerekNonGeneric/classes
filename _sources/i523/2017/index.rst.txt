I523 Big Data Applications and Analytics (2017)
===============================================

.. warning:: This material will be modified and updated on a weekly
             bases througought the semester. Some unit and section
             numbers in the presentations may not correspond to our
             outline here as we have restructured the material.

.. note:: This class has a significant amount of programming
          assignments. However, an option of taking the class without
          programming **project** is available. Those electing not to
          do the programming project need to write a high quality
          academic paper.  The maximum grade of those conducting the
          academic paper option is an A-. It is still expected that
          you conduct the programming assignments even if you do not
          chose the programming project.

.. note:: This class will not have any bonus projects as we want that
          you focus on the class homework, programming
          assignmenst and final project and make them outstanding.
