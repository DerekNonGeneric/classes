I523 Big Data Applications and Analytics (2017)
===============================================

.. warning:: The first lectures will be release on Aug 25, 2017. For
             now we just provide initial draft material. 

.. warning:: This material will be modified and updated on a weekly
             bases througought the semester. Some unit and section
             numbers in the presentations may not correspond to our
             outline here as we have restructured the material.

.. note:: This class has a significant amount of programming
          assignments. One of the assignments is going to be a **term
          project** that requires programming. However it is possible
          to substitue the term project with an **academic term
          paper** that does not require programming. This however does
          not mean that you can skip the other programming
          assignments. Those electing doing the term paper can receive
          a maximum grade of an A- for the class.

.. note:: This class will not have any bonus projects as we want that
          you focus on the class assignments and make them truly outstanding.
