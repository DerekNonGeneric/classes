===============================================



.. warning:: This material will be modified and updated on a weekly
             bases througought the semester. Some unit and section
             numbers in the presentations may not correspond to our
             outline here as we have restructured the material.

.. note:: This class has a significant amount of programming
          assignments. However, an option of taking the class without
          programming **term project** is available. This however does
          not mean that you can skip the programming
          assignments. Those electing doing the programming
          project need to write a high quality **academic term paper**.  The
          maximum grade of those conducting the academic paper option
          is an A-. 

.. note:: This class will not have any bonus projects as we want that
          you focus on the class assignments and make them truly outstanding.

   
Class Piazza
------------

We will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly
catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the
TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff,
I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any
problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.
