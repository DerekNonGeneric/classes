Managing Multiple Python Versions with Pyenv
============================================

Python has several versions that are used by the community. This
inlcudes Python 2 and Python 3, but alls different management of the
python libraries. As each OS may have their own version of python
installed. It is not recommended that you modify that version. Instead
you may want to create a localized python instalation that you as a
user can modify. To do that we recommend *pyenv*. Pyenv allows users
to switch between multiple versions of Python
(https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv). To summarize:

* users to  change the global Python version on a per-user basis;
* users to enable support for per-project Python versions;
* easy version changes without complex environment variable
  management;
* to search installed commands accross different python versions;
* integrate with tox (https://tox.readthedocs.io/).

Install pyenv on OSX
--------------------

We describe here a mechanism of installing pyenv with homebrew. Other
mechanisms can be found on the pyenv documentation page
(https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-installer). First, make sure you have
xcode installed::
  
   $ xcode-select --install

Next install homebrew, pyenv, pyenv-virtualenv and
pyenv-virtualwrapper. Additionally install readline and
some compression tools::

   /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
   brew update
   brew install pyenv pyenv-virtualenv pyenv-virtualenvwrapper
   brew install readline xz

Install pyenv on Ubuntu
-----------------------

.. warning:: the instalation on ubuntu is not tested and we are
             looking fro feedback
             
::

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install git python-pip make build-essential libssl-dev
   sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev
   sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper

   git clone https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
   git clone https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenvwrapper.git ~/.pyenv/plugins/pyenv-virtualenvwrapper

   echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'pyenv virtualenvwrapper' >> ~/.bashrc


Instalation without pyenv
-------------------------
If you need to have more than one python version
installed and do not want or can use pyenv, we recommend you download and install python 2.7.13
and 3.6.1 from python.org (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Install Different Python Versions
---------------------------------

You can now install different versions of python into your local
environment with the following commands::

   $ pyenv install 2.7.13
   $ pyenv install 3.6.1

You can set the global python defualt version with::

   $ pyenv global 2.7.13

Type the following to determine which versions you have available::

   $ pyenv version

Associate a specifc environment name with a certain python version,
use the following commands::
  
   $ pyenv virtualenv 2.7.13 ENV2
   $ pyenv virtualenv 3.6.1 ENV3

In the example above, `ENV2` would represent python 2.7.13 while `ENV3`
would represent python 3.6.0. Often it is easier to type the alias rather 
than the explicit version.
   
Set up the Shell
-----------------

To make all work smoothly from your terminal, you can 
include the follwowing in your .bashrc files::

   export PYENV_VIRTUALENV_DISABLE_PROMPT=1
   eval "$(pyenv init -)"
   eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"

   __pyenv_version_ps1() {
     local ret=$?;
     output=$(pyenv version-name)
     if [[ ! -z $output ]]; then
       echo -n "($output)"
     fi
     return $ret;
   }

   PS1="\$(__pyenv_version_ps1) ${PS1}"

We recommend that you do this towards the end of your file.   
   
Switching Environments
----------------------

After setting up the different environments, switching between them is now easy.
Simply use the following commands::

  
  (2.7.13) $ pyenv activate ENV2
  (ENV2) $ pyenv activate ENV3
  (ENV3) $ pyenv activate ENV2
  (ENV2) $ pyenv deactivate ENV2
  (2.7.13) $ 

To make it even easier, you can add the following lines to your `.bash_profile`
file::

  alias ENV2="pyenv activate ENV2"
  alias ENV3="pyenv activate ENV3"

If you start a new terminal, you can switch between the different
versions of python simply by typing::

  $ ENV2
  $ ENV3

Try it out.

Make sure pip is up to date
---------------------------

As you will want to install other packages, make sure pip is up to
date::

   pip install pip -U


Anaconda
--------

.. warning:: We do not recommend that you use anaconda as it may
	     interfere with your default python interpreters and
	     setup.

.. warning:: This section about anaconda is experimental and has not
             been tested.


You can add anaconda to your pyenv with the following commands::

   pyenv install anaconda2-4.3.1
   pyenv install anaconda3-4.3.1

Here we install both the version 2 and version 3 python environments
from anavconda. Please be aware that the install may tacke several
minutes. Make sure to install the latest release which you can find
out if you leave of the version after the 2 or 3.
   
When executing::

   pyenv versions

you will see after the install completed the anaconda versiosn installed::
   
   pyenv versions
   system
   2.7.13
   2.7.13/envs/ENV2
   3.6.1
   3.6.1/envs/ENV3
   * ENV2 (set by PYENV_VERSION environment variable)
   ENV3
   anaconda2-4.3.1
   anaconda3-4.3.1

Let us now create virtualenv for anaconda::

   $ pyenv virtualenv anaconda2-4.3.1 ANA2
   $ pyenv virtualenv anaconda3-4.3.1 ANA3

   
   
Excersise
---------

pyenv.1:
   Write installation instructions for an operating system of your choice
   and add to this documentation.

pyenv.2:
   Replicate the steps above, so you can type in ENV2 and ENV3 in your
   terminals to switch between python 2 and 3.
