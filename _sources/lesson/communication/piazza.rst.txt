Piazza
======

We use Piazza (https://piazza.com) because questions and answers on
Piazza are community-edited.  Each question has a single answer edited
by the students of the class and if needed an instructors' answer that
is collaboratively edited by the instructors.

Due to this wiki-style Q&A, when a student has a question, one does
not have to look through long e-mail threads but instead can look at the
answer. For details that lead up to the answer you are highly
encouraged to also  look at some comments that lead up to the answer

An advertisement video from Piazza summarizes the features:

Canvas Integration
------------------

Piazza is one of the recommended IU supported technologies within Canvas. It
replaces the CANVAS discussion groups with superior technology targeted
to support large student classes while also focussing on student engagement.

To access piazza you can have the following situation:

a) you have never logged into piazza

>    If this applies to you send us your instructions and we add them here

b) you have logged into piazza and used your IU e-mail

>    If this applies to you send us your instructions and we add them here

c) you have logged into piazza and you used another non IU e-mail

>    If this applies to you send us your instructions and we add them here

d) you have multiple accounts in piazza in which case you must merge them

>    If this applies to you send us your instructions and we add them here

I post the official response form the CANVAS team here:

"When a student clicks the Piazza link in your course navigation, they will
be authenticated through to Piazza. If the student already has a Piazza
account that matches their default Canvas email, they will simply be
enrolled in the Piazza course. If the student doesn't have an account,
Canvas sends the pertinent information (default email address primarily) to
Piazza, Piazza creates the student's account and enrolls the student in the
Piazza course. There is nothing you need to do to."

If you have any questions regarding accessing piazza, please send them to

"Ricci, Margaret P" <mricci@iu.edu>

Verify you are on Piazza via a post
-----------------------------------

Post on the **bio** folder a short introduction about
yourself. One that you could include in a paper.

Making Piazza Work
------------------

In order for Piazza to work students and instructors need to participate

**Students participate:** Students must collaboratively work on an
answer to a question. Students must not post irrelevant followups to a
question. If you notice your comment was irrelevant, please delete it.
Students must **search** prior to asking a new question if the
question has already been asked. Duplicated questions can be merged.

**Instructors guide:** The instructor guides the students in
order to obtain an answer to a question. In some cases the instructor
may be the only one knowing the answer in which case he tries to
provide it.

**Not using e-mail:** Instructors will and must not use e-mail to
communicate with a student. All communication will be done via
piazza. There, are only very view situations where e-mail is allowed,
ask on piazza first if you should engage in e-mail conversations.

**Not using CANVAS discussions:** We will not engage in any CANVAS
message exchange. Any communication is to be done on Piazza. It is in
your responsibility to enroll in Piazza to make it work for
you. Instructions are posted in this document.

Towards good questions
----------------------

Naturally when you ask a question you need to do it in a reasonable
form and provide sufficient information so that the question can be
answered. It is in the responsibility of the student to update the
question to provide enough information.

Thus information may include: 
* Firstname 
* Lastname
* PID
* HID
* URL to document in question

To give you an example of a **bad** question consider::

  *send from Xi Lee*

  Hi Professor:

  I read a nice article about apples and potato's and updated my
  paper. Please give me feedback

  Thank you

  Kevin

Here the reasons why this can be improved:

1. As professors and instructors may review your document it is
   unnecessary to start with "Hi Professor:", just leave it away. If
   you want a particular instructor use the name explicitly, such as
   "Gregor:", e.g. multiple professors may be teaching your course.

2. You have not specified which article you read, you need to include
   the URL to the article so we can follow your argument.

3. You have not included the link to your document so we do not know
   what you are talking about. Remember there are many others students
   in the class

4. You are using a different name from the one that you are registered
   with. This can lead to confusion when we look up your name. We
   prefer that you use only one name that is associated with your e-mail.

The above question will simply be commented on (if at all):

"Missing information" or "?" indicating that information is missing.

Guide on how to ask good questions
----------------------------------

This guide is adapted from

* http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/how-ask-question-when-you-want-technical-help.htm

Ten steps to getting your question answered on piazza

1. Before you even go to ask a question, think through what your problem
   is. Write down how you are going to describe it. Think about it
   from the other side - what would you need to know if a student 
   came to you and asked the question? Gather all the system information
   that seems to bear on the problem (see how at this link). Sometimes
   it even happens that by thinking through the problem, you come up
   with the answer yourself.

2. Verify that your question has not yet been answered with a search on
   the Web, Class Web page, or class piazza, this may require multiple
   searches.

3. In case it is a technical question, write down any error codes that
   appear on your screen. do **not use screenshots** if the text is
   characters. This is because a reply my need to paste and copy from
   the original. Also screenshots are not searchable. We will not
   answer any questions that post screenshots if they are not
   necessary. It is far easier to copy and paste and use terminal type
   in the formatting. Also if the text is posted it is
   searchable. (Any unnecessary screenshot will receive a point
   deduction. Based on experience we have to do this as previous
   students in other classes ignored this policy).


3. Place your question or problem in a forum that is relevant to its
   subject. That may seem obvious but anyone who has experience with
   forums knows that a lot of questions show up in the wrong place.
   YOu will need to identify one or more a fitting piazza "folders"
   (folders sort the posts by topics). 

3. Select a title that briefly and accurately describes your
   problem. A title like “Help!” or “Computer won’t work” will often
   get ignored. Almost any problem can be titled with a few key words
   that will raise interest in somebody who is familiar with the
   subject. A corollary to this is to avoid using all caps or a lot of
   exclamation points. Something like “HELP!!!” turns many people off.

4. In the post, briefly describe the problem in a paragraph. Leave out
   unnecessary details. Save everybody time by listing any solutions
   that you have tried but didn't work. Avoid using screenshots if
   they are not needed. (I mention this again).

5. IN case of a technical issue describe relevant system details. For example, it is
   essential to designate your operating system and type of computer
   and any components that might be involved in your problem. List any
   error code that has been displayed. Be prepared to provide more
   details if asked.

6. Tell what you were doing when you encountered the problem. If it is
   a reproducible problem, list the steps or computer operations  that
   cause the problem.
   
7. If applicable, List any recent software you have installed or hardware changes you
   have made. If you have updated any drivers recently, also list
   that. 

9. Formulate your questions and answers in a courteous manner. Respect
   the answers from others. Somebody is giving you their time and expertise
   for free. You may want to come back to the forum and it pays to be
   friendly.

10. If a suggested solution works, be sure to return to piazza and
    report your success. It is the least you can do to return
    something for the help you have been given. It will make you
    welcome in the forum the next time you go there for help.
