Gregor von Laszewski is an Assistant Director of Cloud Computing in
the DSC. His is also an Adj. Assoc. Professor of the Intelligent
Systems Engineering Department at Indiana University. He held a
position at Argonne National Laboratory from Nov. 1996 â€“ Aug.  2009
where he was last a scientist and a fellow of the Computation
Institute at University of Chicago. During the last two years of that
appointment he was on sabbatical and held a position as Associate
Professor and the Director of a Lab at Rochester Institute of
Technology focussing on Cyberinfrastructure. He received a Masters
Degree in 1990 from the University of Bonn, Germany, and a Ph.D. in
1996 from Syracuse University in computer science. He was involved in
Grid computing since the term was coined. He was the lead of the Java
Commodity Grid Kit (http://www.cogkit.org) which provides till today a
basis for many Grid related projects including the Globus
toolkit. Current research interests are in the areas of Cloud
computing. He is leading the effort to develop a simple IaaS client
available at as OpenSource project at
http://cloudmesh.github.io/client/

His Web page is located at http://gregor.cyberaide.org. To contact him
please send mail to laszewski@gmail.com. For class related e-mail
please use Piazza for this class.

In his free time he teaches Lego Robotics to high school students. In 2015
the team won the 2nd prize in programming design in Indiana. If you like
to volunteer helping in this effort please contact him.

He offers also the opportunity to work with him on interesting
independent studies. Current topics include but are not limited to

* cloudmesh
* big data for NIST
* big data benchmarking.
* scientific impact of supercomputer and data centers.
* STEM and other educational activities while using robotics or big data

Greoffrey C. Fox received a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from Cambridge University
and is now distinguished professor of Informatics and Computing, and
Physics at Indiana University where he is director of the Digital
Science Center, Chair of Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering
and Director of the Data Science program at the School of Informatics
and Computing.  He previously held positions at Caltech, Syracuse
University and Florida State University after being a postdoc at the
Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
and Peterhouse College Cambridge. He has supervised the PhD of 68
students and published around 1200 papers in physics and computer
science with an index of 70 and over 26000 citations.  He currently
works in applying computer science from infrastructure to analytics in
Biology, Pathology, Sensor Clouds, Earthquake and Ice-sheet Science,
Image processing, Deep Learning, Manufacturing, Network Science and
Particle Physics. The infrastructure work is built around Software
Defined Systems on Clouds and Clusters. The analytics focuses on
scalable parallelism.

He is involved in several projects to enhance the capabilities of
Minority Serving Institutions. He has experience in online education
and its use in MOOCs for areas like Data and Computational Science. He
is a Fellow of APS (Physics) and ACM (Computing).


Dr. Badi' Abdul-Wahid
---------------------

Badi' received a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Notre
Dame under Professor Jesus Izaguirre. The primary focus of his
graduate work was the development of scalable, fault-tolerant, elastic
distributed applications for running Molecular Dynamics simulations.

At Indiana University, Badi' works with the FutureSystems project
on a NIST-funded study whose goal is to understand patterns in the
development and usage of Big Data Analysis pipelines.


Teaching Assistants
-------------------

Jerome Mitchell
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: /images/jerome.png

**Jerome Mitchell** is a Ph.D candidate in computer science at Indiana
University and is interested in coupling the fields of computer and
polar science. He has participated in the United State Antarctic
Program, (USAP), where he collaborated with a multidisciplinary team
of engineers and scientists to design a mobile robot for harsh polar
environments to autonomously collect ice sheet data, decrease the
human footprint of polar expeditions, and enhance measurement
precision. His current work include: using machine learning techniques
to help polar scientists identify bedrock and internal layers in radar
imagery. He has also been involved in facilitating workshops to
educate faculty and students on the importance of parallel and
distributed computing at minority-serving institutions.
