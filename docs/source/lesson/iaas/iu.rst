It is important to visit this page to look at the Tips before you send
questions to us or the Help Desk.

If your computer is not powerful enough you probably can log into one
of these machines to do LaTeX and other software for classes. In the
case of python, you will have to make sure you have the right
version. You can send a Help message to the Help Desk.

Burrow:
  burrow.soic.indiana.edu
  The Burrow systems are available to all SoIC faculty, staff, and
  students (both graduate and undergraduate students in CS or
  Informatics) as well as non-SoIC students who are taking CS or
  Informatics classes requiring the use of these systems. Accounts are
  created automatically for all SoIC graduate students and for
  undergraduate students taking certain SoIC classes. If you are a
  faculty, staff, or undergraduate student in the CS or Informatics
  program and do not already have a Burrow account, you can request an
  account using the Help Desk. Note that account requests for non-SoIC
  students should come from the instructor of the class using these
  systems.

Sharks:
  sharks.soic.indiana.edu
  The Sharks systems are available to all SoIC faculty, staff, and
  graduate students (CS and Informatics). Access can also be granted to
  undergraduate and non-SoIC students and guests with sponsorship by a
  member of the SoIC faculty. Accounts are created automatically for all
  SoIC graduate students (CS and Informatics). Accounts for other users
  can be created by having the faculty sponsor make the account request
  using the Help Desk.
