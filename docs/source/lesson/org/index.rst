============

Any course we teach in the department needs some basic knowledge about
linux, programming, cloud computing, and documentation creation. We
have taken the lessons from a number of courses and made them
available as general available lessons. This enables you to leverage
information you have been previously taught while expanding upon it
or refreshing it. If you have not been exposed to these lessons or the
material before, you are welcome to use them to make sure you learn the
tools we use in the class.

Lessons may have homework attached with them. Please note that the
homework are unrelated to the course that you may take and that they
may not be assigned as part of this course. To make sure to see what
is needed for a course, please visit the overview page of a course,
that lists all homework for the appropriate course. It is just like if
you were to take a regular class that has a text book. The teacher may
elect to skip a chapter, or decide to assign just a subset of
assignments. Assignments that are not listed in the overview are not
graded.

.. note:: Please also note the lessons presented here are not
	  necessarily given in order. Instead they are topically
	  grouped and within the topic sorted alphabetically. If you
	  are looking for an order in which you elect to follow the
	  lessons you need to refer to the class overview or syllabus.
