Report Format
=============

Over the years we got tired of student that asked us how many pages a
report needs to be and than turn around and play with spacing, fonts
and other space manipulations to circumvent these
recommendations. Thus we have adopted a much simpler approach. All
reports **must** be written in the same format that we define provide
for this class. The template for the report is available from:

*
https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/tree/master/docs/source/format/simple/latex

Convenient compressed files are available at

*
https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/tree/master/docs/source/format/report.tar.gz
*
https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/tree/master/docs/source/format/report.zip



It is in your best interest to use LaTeX. The good news is that
we have made it simple for you to use and you are allowed to use
online services. 

An example report in PDF format is available:

* `report.pdf <https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/blob/master/docs/source/format/simple/latex/report.pdf>`_
  
It includes some very simple `makefile <https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/blob/master/docs/source/format/simple/Makefile>`_
and allows you to do editing with immediate preview as documented in
the LaTeX lesson.  Due to LaTeX being a trivial ASCII based format and
its superior bibliography management you wil save yourself many hours
of work. 

In case you are in a team, you can use either git while
collaboratively developing the LaTeX document, use sharelatex, or
overleaf.

Your final submission must be in git, we will not review any
documents stored on sharelatex or overleaf. Your final submission will
include the bibliography file as a separate document. All images must
be placed in an images folder and submitted in your repository with
the originals. When using sharelatex or overleaf you must replicate
the directory layout carefully. You must also make sure that all files
and directories in sharelatex you use be copied back to git.

.. warning:: There will be **NO EXCEPTION** to this format. Hence if
	     you do not know latex we recommend you get familiar with
	     it. Documents not written in LaTeX that do not follow the
	     specified format and are not accompanied by references
	     managed with jabref and are not spell checked will be
	     returned without review.

.. warning:: We found that students using MsWord or Google docs
	     produce inferior reports with the danger of
	     having a lower grade. Hence, in order to help you achieve
	     the best grade possible, we no longer accept reports
	     using these tools and require that all documents be
	     written in LaTeX.

As we have observed that **ALL** stduents that used MSWord in previous
classes delivered inferior reports we adopted the
following policy for this class to discourage the use of Word:

* Any student wanting to use Word will get an automatic 20% point deduction, all
  refernces must be managed in endnote. We like to point out that it
  is **VERY** difficult to use endnote in a collaborative setting and
  we have seen students working for months at a document and at the
  end it was broken due to either bugs in word or endnote. We realy do
  not want you to experience this. It is var easier to learn LaTeX
  than to risk losing month worth of work. 
  
* Furthermore, we will reject any paper that is not using proper
  bibliography management tools.

Writing proper academic resources is part of **ANY** report handed in
as part of a graduate course. 
  
Report Checklist
----------------

This incomplete list may serve as a way to check if you follow the rules

#. Have you written the report in LaTeX in the specified format?
#. Have you included an Acknowledgement section?
#. Have you included the report in git?
#. Have you specified the HID, names, and e-mails of all team members in
   your report. E.g. the Real Names that are registered in Canvas?
#. Have you included the project number in the report?
#. Have you included all images in native and PDF format in git in
   the images folder?
#. Have you added the bibliography file that you managed with jabref
#. Have you added an appendix describing who did what in the project
   or report?
#. Have you spellchecked the paper?
#. Have you made sure you do not plagiarize?
#. Have you not used phrases such as shown in the Figure below, but
   instead used as shown in Figure 3 when referring to the 3rd
   figure?
#. Have you capitalizezed "Figure 3", "Table 1", ... ?
#. Any figure that is not referred to explicitly in the text must be
   removed?
#. Are the figure captions bellow the figures and not on top. (Do
   not include the titles of the figures but instead use the caption
   or that information?
#. When using tables put the table caption on top?
#. Make the figures large enough so we can see it, regardless of page
   restrictions. If needed make the figure over two columns?
#. Do not worry about the figure placement if they are at a different
   location than you think. Figures are allowed to float. If you want
   you can place all figures at the end of the report?
#. Do not use the word "I"?
#. Do not artificially inflate your report if you are bellow the page
   limit and have nothing to say anymore?
#. If your paper limit is 12 pages but you want to hand in 120 pages,
   please check first with an instructor ;-)
#. Check in your current work of the report on a weekly basis to show
   consistent progress?
#. Is in your report directory a README.rst file in it as shown in the
   example project that we introduced you to?



Exercise
--------

Report.6:
  What is an InProceedings and how does it differ from Conference?

Report.7:  
  What is a Misc?

Report.8:
  Why are spaces, underscores in directory names
  problematic and why should you avoid using them for your projects

Report.9:
  Write an objective report about the advantages and disadvantages of
  programs to write reports.
