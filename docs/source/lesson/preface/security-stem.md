## Recreational Recess Activities (for STEM students only)

As part of courses (typically offered in camp settings) we may also
have students that are under age. For STEM students we like to remind
them that the same rules apply that they have at their elementary,
middle, and highschools. Instructors may decide to do some
recreational indoor and outdoor activities. Participants are required
to follow instructions from instructors and avoiding dangerous
activities. The same recess rules as in your school apply. If in
doubt, ask.

Rules and expectations:

* No physical contact (i.e., pushing, hitting, fighting, kicking) or tackle sports.
* No carrying others on your back.
* Keep sticks, rocks, and snow on the ground and do not throw them.
* There will be NO jumping off of equipment, tables, benches.
* Soccer balls, kickballs, footballs, etc. may be brought onto the field. Be carefull not to hurt others.
* Enjoy playing in the green space around the rugby are, but stay close to the building and in sight.
* No climbing on the fences and trees or running through plants/ trees.

Character expectations:

* Students need to follow the teacher’s/associate’s directions 
* Use only acceptable language–swearing, name-calling is not allowed. Give put-ups instead!
* Invite and include all when playing – “Don’t say, you can’t play!”
* No bullying
