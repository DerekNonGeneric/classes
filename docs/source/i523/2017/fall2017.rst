Course Information and Calendar
===============================

Warning: Information will change.

.. note:: This class ends on Dec 15 and not earlier. Residential
   students are required to attend all Friday classes including those
   held in Dec. Missing such classes will result in grade
   reduction. We will implement a strict policy. Only for medical
   reasons a class can be missed. The reasoning for this is that
   residential students that did not attend classes regularly tend to
   do not as well in this class as their colleagues.

Notebook
--------

Students are required to maintain a notebook in github in which they
summarize their weekly activities for this course. This includes a
self maintained list of which lecture material they viewed.


Calendar
--------

  * You must have created a gitlab repository in our class repository. (Graded homework, no extensions)
  * You must be in the class Piazza (Graded homework, no extensions).
  * Why no extensions: if we can not communicate with you we can not conduct the class.
    Everyone must be in piazza and gitlab timely. Instead of giving points we will deduct points
    from everyone that has not done it in time. Those that registered late have one week from the

Incomplete
-----------

Incomplete's will receive a fractional Grade reduction. Example A will
become A-, A- will become B+, and so forth.  There is enough time in
the course to complete all assignments without getting an incomplete.

Why do we have such a policy? As we teach state-of-the-art software
this software is subject to change, not only within the course, but
also after the course. As we may offer some services and only have
access to the TA's during the semester it is obvious that we like all
class projects and homework assignments to be completed within a
semester. Services that were offered during the semester may no longer
be available after the semester is over and could adversely effect
your planing. It will be in the students responsibility to identify
such services and provide alternatives if they become unavailable. We
try hard to avoid this but we can not guarantee it.

Furthermore once an incomplete is requested, you will have 10 month to
complete it. We will need 2 month to grade. No grading will be
conducted over breaks. This may effect those that require student
loans. Please plan ahead.

Auditing the class
------------------

.. warning:: degree seeking students have preference to take this
             class. If the class is full and degree seeking students
             are on the waiting list auditing and non-degree students
             will have to wait till all others have been able to
             enroll. IF space permits only than autiting and non
             degree students can enroll.
   
In case you like to audit the class or like to take it as part of a
nondegree program the following applies:

Participation in the class is approved for non degree student and
studnets that like to audit the clss under the following conditions:

#. Due to limited space enrollment in the residential class is not
   allowed. The class must be taken online.

#. To assure that the full value of the class is applied all homework
   (graded and ungraded) must be conducted.

#. For non degree students and students that audit the class an
   incomplete will not be allowed. The class homework must be
   completed in the semester as some software and services will only
   be accessible during the semester. In case an incomplete takes
   place additional effort may take place on the students side as
   software and course material in the class evolve. As we use
   state-of-the-art software we can naturally not guarantee that
   software that needs to be updated will be available in the same
   form after or even during the the class as this contradicts the
   definition of state-of-the-art (e.g. if a software update is needed
   it will be applied). A10% grade deduction will be applied if an
   incomplete is requested. An incomplete requires 2 month review
   time.

#. Accounts and services can not be shared and will be disabled once
   the class is over.

#. It is not allowed to use our services for profit (e.g. just
   enrolling in the class to use our clouds).

#. In case of abuse of available compute time on our clouds the
   student is aware that we will terminate the computer account on our
   clouds and she may have to conduct the project on a public cloud or
   his own computer under her own cost. There will be no guarantee
   that cloud services we offer will be available after the semester
   is over. Projects can be conducted as part of the class that do not
   require access to the cloud.
