Organization
============

This class is an online class. Online classes requireYou to be very disciplinedIn order to execute the tasksNecessary for the class. It is it your responsibility to organize the lessons and the fashion so that you can conduct themBy the end of the semester. This is a great opportunity for youTo structureThe verb based on your availability. However, you will have a weekly meeting with the instructor or teaching assistants so they are able to help you with the questions you may have or the lecture material. The classes are attended by two different set of students. One set are pure online students, while to other are are residential students. For the residential students we have a mandatory in person meeting that takes place at the posted location and hours.  For pure online stidents we have weekly online hours that we will identify based on our availability and a doodle poll.

**Figure:** Components of the Class 

First Week
----------

In the first week we will be introducing you how we communicate in the class. Naturally you need to  register for the class. Once you register you need to set up a number of services. The content for this class will be available though the Cloudmesh classes Web page on github. All communication is done with Piazza. We have prepared a special section on how you can access Piazza directly from Canvas. Please follow the instructions and let us know if there are any issues.
You will also need an account on github.com as we like to introduce you to community tools that are used by the community. Knowing github will be extremely valuable for you not only for this class, but also once you graduate. We will have a special lecture for you on this topic and we expect that you provide us with feedback about your github username.

Assignments:
* register for the class
* get github account
* enroll in Piazza via Canvas (see instructions in the class outline)
* create a post in Piazza (use the bio folder) (we need to verify you can post)

IoT Hardware
------------

As part of this class you also have the ability to take part in some Internet of Things  related projects and assignments. If you like to experiment with real hardware, I recommend you to buy an esp8266 or a Rasperry PI 3. In fact the hardware of both are so cheap that you could experiment with both of them. Please consult with our hardware page what is possible. While an esp8266 can be purchased for about $7 a Raspberry Pi with case and power supply will cost you about $50.

Access to Clouds
----------------

As part of the course you will also need access to a computer. We will try best to provide you with access to suitable computers for the class, but do be reminded that the amoount of time and access to supercomputers and Clouds we offer is limited. Our class policy is to use the compute resources only when you realy need them. Thus you **must** shut down your VMs when they are not in use. It would be a violation of class policy if we would find out through an analysis of the cloud logs that you uneccesarrily keep your VMs running. Thus we will implement a policy that you must record yourself how many hours you run and provide this information to us. We will than compare that time with the time recorded by the computer system as well as with your target application and will deduct points form your project if you can not justify why you have not shut down your VMs. A resource section needs to be added to your report justifiyng the used resources.

Why is this such a big deal you may ask? For example we estimate if every student in class violates this policy it would cost about $200000 to rent the time for this on a public cloud. Hence, we no longer tollorate deliberate violations of the policy and will terminate your account. Furthermore, violators will have to find alternative resources to conduct your project on your own. In our case the problem is bigger as our allocation on the clouds would be shut down and **no student**, including those that follow policies, could use the cloud. It may take weeks to reestablish cloud access. 

We will provide clarification for accessing cloud resources and teach you how to avoid getting in such a situation. I am sure that a future employer of yours will be real happy if you have a deep understanding of resource vs. cost estimate.

Using Your Own Computer
-----------------------

In many cases howeve you could be using your own personal computer, but make sure the computer is up-to-date. This does not mean that you need to buy a new computer, or need to upgrade it. However, if you consider an upgrade of an older machine please consider the following.

Today we recommend that your computer has a a solid-state drive and maximized memory. Computers these days typically have 16 GB off main memory, a minimum of eight is required. When it comes to buying a solid-state drive, make sure that you buy one that is compatible with motherboards bus speed. As you may want to reuse your solid-state drive at a later time I suggest to get a 6GB/s SSD and not a 3GB/s.

Students that only had a chromebook and took this class gave us the feedback that they are too inconvenient as they do not allow you to program directly in python on them.

If money is an issue, you can buy a Raspberry Pi and edit your programs there and when satisfied run them on a cloud.

We also like to remind you that thsi course does not require you to purchase expensive text books, thus the money you safe on this could be used in upgrading your hardware.

Parallel Traks
--------------

In this class we start out with three parallel tracks. You will be doing all of them.

Track 1: Practice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Trak 1 introduces you to using python for Big Data. Although you do not need to know any programming language, it is certainly useful as it will make this course much easier for you. We had students that had no prior programming knowledge and successfully completed the course. So we know it can be done. We also had other students that dropped the class as they felt they need mor etime to learn programming. It will be up to you to make that assessment.
  
We provid eyou with a general introduction to Python. This includes enough knowledge so you can conduct a project with it. We will reenforce this knowledge wile exposing you to IoT devices that you can program in python such as the esp8266 and the Raspberry PI. Residential students that have purchased a Raspberry PI, will also have the opertunity to integrate them between each other to create a compute cluster or a virtual cluster while using state of the art container technology. You can than compare the compute power of that cluster with your own Laptop, or a cluster hosted in the cloud.

We will build on these technologies to introduce you to python libraries that can be used for big data. We also will introduce you to analytics algorithm such as k-means and others to understand some of their intrinsic functionality.

Optionally, we also offer you the chance to integrate DevOps into your projects (which is typically covered in I524) for the most advanced students of the class. However, we have a real simple solution while using our own cloudmesh cmd5 to provide an easy interface to reproducable environments that coul be used by anyone in the class.

Knowing how to write is a preparation for your term project. If you elect to do a term paper you still have to conduct the programming assignments.

Track 2: Theory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The theory track includes a number of online lectures that introduces you to a variety of topics related to Big Data. You have especially the oportunity to become part of a project that would contribute to the understanding and the development of a Big Data Architecture developed in collaboration with NIST. Other topics that are covered include IoT, Helath Care, Pysics, Science, Biology, Genomics, and so forth. We will update the Theory track on a weekly basis and will release lectures in the specified areas. Knowing how to write is a preparation for your term project/paper.

Track 3: Writing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This track will introduce you into how to write an academic paper and conduct proper bibligraphy management.
You will be writing 2 papers that include 2 pages per collaborator on a particular topic. We like to avoid that all students take the same topic, so we will identify with you a mechanism to split up the different topics. We like to conduct the topic assignment ASAP so you can start. As document format we will be useing our class specific 2 column format that can be used either in LaTeX or Word. YOu can use collaborative tools such as ShareLatex, Overleaf, and Microsoft Onedrive. Please not this is an academic paper and not an experience report, or a magazine article, or a blog. Knowing how to write is a preparation for your term project/paper.


Track 4: Term Paper/Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The major deliverable of the course is a term project or paper. The exact details will be posted on the Web page and depends on if you conduct the project/paper in a team or alone. Details will be available, but will likely replicate what we set for I524. The important part is that you start on this project once you are sufficiently familiar with Track 1-3. However you cabn also use the project to for example learn python and engage in a goal oriented learning activity while working towards implementing your project and integarting the python lessons that you encounter. The same is valid for the theory.

It is **expected** that you identify a suitable analysis and data set for the project and that you learn how to apply this analysis as well as justify it.

More details will be posted onece we have introduced you to some elementary concpets so we can discuss them easier.

Furthermore it is also important to note that if you do not a project (this is your option) the maximum grade for the entire class is limited to an A-. It will be up to you to assess what you want to do and selfassesment is a real good way to do that. Not only that, you should not expect to get an A if you yourself are not convinced about your project or are unsure about it. Common sense prevales.

Self Discipline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As this class has no graded tests and only few graded homework, we like that you deliver an exceptional project report or paper. Instead of focussing on preparing for tests we provide you with the opportunity to **explore** without the preasure of grades. However you should not give up or take the easy way out or it will effect you in your project execution. All this this requires discipline. For example, if you believe you are so good that you can do a project within one week before deadline, you will fail. To avoid this and to introduce dicipline, you will also be monitored on progress and we check your github for activities which will be part of the participation grade.

Fun
^^^
I hope you have fun and are a ble to integrate in the projects your own thoughts

Uniqueness
^^^^^^^^^^
We will try to have every project or paper to be non overlapping with another topic, If there are overlaps we may ask you to modify your focus.
