Paper 1 Homework
================

.. note:: A video showing you how to get started on the paper is
          available on the `class YouTube account
          <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q2TNpeGajQ>`_.

In this homework you will write a short paper on one of the
technologies that was assigned to you in the :ref:`TechList homework
<techs-exercise>`. In the process, you will learn how to write a basic
`LaTeX <https://www.latex-project.org/>`_ document. LaTeX is a
document type setting environment used for writing scientific papers in
many fields, and it is what we will use to write all papers in the
class. Even if you are not planning to work in academia, LaTeX is a
very powerful tool and can be useful for typesetting other types of
documents, such as magazine articles, CVs, resumes, books and so on.

**Detailed instructions on the steps for obtaining the template and
compiling it can be found in the homework submission repository at:**

Writing the Paper
-----------------

For the actual content of the paper, you need to write a two page
overview of one of the technologies assigned to you in the TechList
assignment. *The two pages refer to the amount of text you should
write; references, figures and other similar items are not included.*
Your intended audience should be someone who might not have specific
technical background in the area of the technology, but who is a
rigorous thinker and whose problem domain might benefit from it. Thus,
the paper should provide context about the technology such as:

* Summarize the technology briefly
* What kind of problems has it been applied to successfully?
* What kind of infrastructure does it need?
* How does this technology relate to big data?
* What major big data projects have used this technology?
* If I were to be new to the technology, what resources exist to learn
  about it?
* What is the status and popularity of the tool?  Provide evidence, do
  not copy *advertisement* terms from the project..
* What other things are important that you came across? 
* What are alternatives and how does the technology compare to them in
  terms of features, support, performance, etc.
* Make sure you have sufficient references (You need at least one, but
  as you may point to projects using the technology and learning
  material you probably have more, determine the most important once).

Document Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Your paper should have an introduction and a conclusion, and use
sections in the middle portion as needed to be easy to understand.

Writing Style
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Treat this as a scientific paper, so you should aim to inform and give
a well-rounded overview of the subject matter. Do not use superlatives
or adjectives that are more appropriate for an advertisement, such as
*very*, *best*, *cutting-edge*, etc.

In addition, non-trivial statements of fact or quantitative statements
should be supported by other parts of your paper or by citations. For
example, if you are asserting that tech A has more features than tech
B, you can support this by including a table of features that you
create or citing a paper that compared these technologies.

For your citations, use the original source of a finding whenever
possible. That is, if paper A states something and cites paper B as a
source, and paper B cites paper C for the same claim, you need to look
at paper C to make sure the claim is accurate and cite that paper.

  
Submission
----------

Submission of this assignment will be in Github as outlined
above. Please, start early and raise any questions about the above
process on Piazza and in the online office hours. Depending on how
students are doing and what issues they are encountering, we will
